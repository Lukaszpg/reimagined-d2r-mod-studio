# Reimagined D2R Mod Studio

### So why the hell does this tool exist?
Well, there are a few reasons. First off I can't stand the amount of merge conclicts that happen on the game's text files when trying to work in a shared space. It becomes very difficult to view diffs and track changes. Having to juggle multiple tools and constantly navigate the windows explorer made me wanna scream as well

### What were the goals of this project?

* Handles ALL file types that exist in d2r modding. Json, txt, d1s, etc. (Relative tools are opened for each, level editor for example is opened for you when editing those files upon confirmation)
* * I did not want to have to jump between different tools to different thing. You still need to for level editing, sprite editing, etc but this will serve as the entry point to all of that.
* A "Source Directory" and "Deployment Directory" (Store source files, and your mod deployment files in different area. Deploy/Play will bundle and move for you)
* * The ability to seperate your mod install directory and your source directories allows you to add additional files that don't belong in your mod directory. 
* A single "Play" button from within the editor. With options (D2RLoader, vanilla, whatever)
* Fully handles linting and checks for you.
* * Runs the D2RLint tool automatically and keeps your files in check
* Adding in common calculations
* * Hate having to go figure out what the hell the end Health of a monster is? Or what the skill description is? Yea me too. Hopefully this solves that
* Item tooltip rendering in certain views (Hover unique row in unique editor, and see the built item - or error if incorrect)
* New file system - Move away from the .txt files for much better collaboration and less merge conflicts
* Built-in Git (Git tab beside the project tree, Ctrl+K): tick the files to include, commit, push, pull, switch branches, view diffs and history - driven by your installed `git`, so SSH keys and credential managers just work

## Table editor notes

* Every column of a table is shown. Under the hood only the columns near the horizontal viewport exist in the grid (the rest are stood in for by spacers), which is what keeps 300-column tables such as skills, missiles and monstats smooth to scroll in both directions.
* Adding, deleting, pasting, saving, undo and redo keep the grid where you were scrolled; only a new filter goes back to the top.
* **Column guide**: press **F1** (or use the toolbar's ? button, right-click a column header, or click a field name in the Row Editor) for the searchable d2rdoc guide of the current column, with the current cell's code highlighted and a link to the online page. Hovering a header shows a short summary only.
* **Hover cards** on unique/set item rows can be switched off with the toolbar toggle (or in the Item Preview tab); the Item Preview tab always shows the selected item.
* **Column letters**: the toolbar's View menu can put the spreadsheet letter of each column (A … Z, AA …) in front of its name, in headers and in the Row Editor, for people who know the TXT files by letter. Letters follow the file's column order even when columns are frozen or moved on screen, and the Row Editor's search finds a field by its letter. The choice is remembered.
* **Frozen columns** are tinted (cells and header) so they read as one pinned block, the way frozen rows are outlined.
* While a cell is being typed, the status line under the table shows the **character count against the game's 255 limit** and whether **parentheses/brackets balance**; the Row Editor shows the same in its status line and the Details tab under its value box.
* **Arrow keys stay in the cell** while it is being edited: Left/Right move the caret, Up/Down jump to the start/end of the text. Enter and Tab commit, Escape puts the value back as it was.
* **Document tabs** can be dragged sideways to reorder them: a ghost of the tab follows the pointer and a bar marks where it will land; the order is kept with the session.
* **View settings** (toolbar *View* button, or the table toolbar's View menu): table font and size, source editor font and size (a list of common fonts, or any installed one), column letters and item hover cards. **Ctrl + mouse wheel**, **Ctrl + plus / minus** change the text size of the view under the pointer (table or source), **Ctrl + 0** restores the default; all of it is remembered.
* **Colour transforms** (monstats `TransLvl`, superuniques `Utrans`/`(N)`/`(H)`): right-click the cell → *Pick colour transform…*, or the *Pick colour…* button beside the field in the Row Editor. Every hue table of the act palette is drawn as a strip of the colours it produces, with the current value highlighted; clicking a row writes its number into the selected cells. Studio ships no game data: the swatches come from a `pal.pl2` found under the project (`data/global/palette/ACT1/pal.pl2`), the deployed mod, or the game folder, or one you choose once from your extracted game data (remembered in preferences).
* **Source view**: right-click for cut/copy/paste/undo/redo; the bracket at the caret and its partner are highlighted; JSON that no longer parses is marked on its line as you type, with the message in the status line; the editor font and size are set in View settings.
* Build, Deploy and Play report warnings such as an item name with no string-catalog key; the details are in the Problems tab and the **Log** tab keeps every status-bar message (click the status bar to open it).
* **GitHub/CMake builds** are optional per project. *Build settings* selects a GitHub repository plus branch or open pull request; CMake source, target and DLL name are read from that revision's `charsi-package.json`, matching Charsi. Build resolves the revision to an immutable commit SHA and builds locally as Release or Debug, while Deploy adds the DLL to Studio's normal transactional deployment under the existing Run-settings deployment folder. GitHub PATs are stored in Windows Credential Manager and are never written to project/settings JSON or passed to CMake.
* The **deployment folder's name is the mod's name**: Studio lays the build out as `<folder>.mpq` and launches the game with `-mod <folder>`. Deploying to `mods/MyMod-test` therefore runs the same project as a separate mod beside `mods/MyMod`; the folder no longer has to be named after the project.

## UI Designer

Any layout under `data/global/ui/layouts` opens with a **UI Designer** button beside Source: the layout drawn the way the game draws it, on the 3840 × 2160 reference screen, next to a tree of its widgets and an inspector.

* **As in game**: the `basedOn` parent is merged in (fields one by one; a `children` list replaces the parent's, each entry taking on the parent's widget of the same name, and a file with no `children` list keeps the parent's), `$variables` come from the profile (`_profilehd.json`, plus `_profilelv.json` or the `controller/` profiles for the other profiles in the toolbar), `@strings` from your string catalogs, sprites from `data/hd/global/ui` and text is set in the game's own fonts (Exocet, Formal). Studio ships none of these: they are read from the project first, then from your extracted game data folder.
* **Edit on the canvas**: click to select (Alt+click picks what is underneath), drag to move, drag handles to resize (pictures without a size scale instead), arrow keys nudge (Shift ×10). Edges and centres snap to siblings and the parent (hold Ctrl to place freely); with a widget selected, hovering another shows the distance between them.
* **Clean diffs**: every change is written as the smallest text edit that makes it; comments, trailing commas and your formatting stay as they are. Edits share Undo, Save and the dirty marker with the Source view, and *Show in source* jumps to a widget's entry.
* **Where each value comes from**: the inspector marks each field as written in this file, inherited from the parent layout, or a profile `$variable` (with *Go to* for its definition). Changing an inherited widget writes an override for it into this file (the first time, a file that kept the parent's children gets a list naming all of them, so none is dropped); deleting one leaves it out of this file's list, as controller layouts drop close buttons; a `$variable` rect you drag becomes this file's own rect. Parent layouts and profiles are never changed from here; *Copy to project* brings a game-data file into the mod when you do want to change it.
* **Inspector**: position, size, scale and anchor (the 3 × 3 anchor grid keeps the widget where it is on screen unless you untick *Keep on screen*), fit to parent, the picture with a sprite browser and every frame, text with its localized string and a profile style picker, colours, and every field as JSON with suggestions from the fields the game's own layouts use.
* **Preview**: switch profile (PC / controller, normal / large font) and aspect ratio (16:9, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9, 4:3); the *State* menu shows buttons hovered, pressed, disabled or toggled (in Normal the button under the pointer shows its hovered frame); *Layers* draws other layouts underneath, dimmed, such as the HUD under an inventory. Widgets can be hidden on the canvas from the tree without changing the file.
* **Pages**: layouts that hold several screens in one file are shown one screen at a time. The stash opens on its *Personal* tab; the *Page* menu (or clicking a tab on the canvas) switches to *Shared*, *Gems*, *Materials* or *Runes*, each with its own containers and the background the panel's `backgroundFile` lists for it, and the tree fades and folds the other tabs' widgets. Picking a widget from another tab switches to it. Other layouts whose sibling containers overlap (quest log tabs, join-game screens) offer them as pages too, starting from *All pages*. Pages change only what is drawn, never the file.
* Shortcuts: **F** whole screen, **P** the panel, **Z** the selection, **1** actual size, **Ctrl+D** duplicate, **Del** delete, **Esc** select the parent, wheel to zoom, middle-drag or Space+drag to pan. Right-click a widget to add a child, change its draw order or hide it.
* Unresolved `$variables`, missing parent layouts and missing sprites are listed under the canvas. Legacy (SD) layouts are shown with outlines and text; their DC6 art is not drawn.

## Level world map

The `levels` Visual Builder has a **World** card: the act of the level you are editing, seen from above in tiles, laid out the way the game places it.

* **Layout**: each level is a rectangle `SizeX × SizeY` (per difficulty; switch Normal / Nightmare / Hell) at `OffsetX, OffsetY`. A level with a `Depend` is placed from its parent's corner (Courtyard sits above the Monastery). Levels with offset `-1, -1` are placed by the game (the town and wilderness of Act 1, Act 4's Mesa…) and are listed under the map instead of guessed. Outdoor levels the generator chains together are dashed, and their overlaps with each other are not flagged. Any other overlap is outlined in red and listed.
* **Hover** a level for its Id, size and position and every link in and out, with the `lvlwarp` row each `Vis#`/`Warp#` goes through ("via Act 1 Cave Up (warp 4)", "across the border", "one way"). **Click** opens it in the builder; **double-click** opens its map in Level Editor. Ctrl+wheel zooms, right-drag pans, *Fit* shows the whole act.
* **Draw a new level**: drag across empty space. The rectangle turns red where it would overlap a level in any difficulty. Releasing opens a form with the offset and size from what you drew (editable), the name, preset or maze generation, and a level to copy settings from (monsters, tiles, sound, rules, lighting; not its names, waypoint, links or position). *Create level* adds the `levels` row at the bottom with the next Id, `SizeX`/`SizeY` in every difficulty and `OffsetX`/`OffsetY`. For a preset level it also adds a `lvlprest` row (next `Def`, `LevelId`, `File1`, and the template's room flags and `Dt1Mask`) and writes the map pair under `data/`: a blank v18 DS1 with one more cell than the level each way (levels' size is the DS1 header's width and height), and a minimal HD preset JSON lit by the template's biome. It can also copy the template's map instead. Existing files and game maps are never overwritten. Undo removes the rows (each table separately); the files stay. Link the level from another level's Connections, save, then build the map in Level Editor.

## Keep using your TXT editor

Migration does not require using Studio's grid. **External editor** in the toolbar provides:

* **Open External Editor…** for the current table (also in explorer and document-tab context menus).
* **Open External Editor Workspace…** for the deployed `global/excel` folder (also in explorer folder menus).
* Editor settings, synchronization/conflict review, and **End external editing**.

### Synchronization

While Studio is open, saved TXT changes are imported after filesystem activity settles. Saved JSON changes are exported back to the tracked TXT files. Clean open Studio documents refresh automatically; unsaved documents are preserved and must be saved before merging. The external editor controls how it reloads files changed on disk.

The session is stored under `.studio/external-editor` and resumes when the project reopens, including edits saved while Studio was closed. A periodic scan covers missed watcher events. Only generated TXT tables are synchronized; binary files, localization JSON, newly created unmanaged TXT files, and editor configuration files are outside this feature.
